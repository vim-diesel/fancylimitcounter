# FancyLimitCounter

Welcome to FancyLimitCounter! This project is a React application that provides a counter with custom limits. It uses Vite as the build tool and development server for a fast and efficient development experience.

For managing styling we use <💅🏽>styled-components

This project serves no useful purpose beyond demonstrating the use of React, Vite, and Styled-Components in a simple application. It is intended as a learning resource for developers who are new to React or Vite.

- **Vite-Powered**: Uses Vite for a fast development server and build tool.
